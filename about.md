<p class="lead">Muhammad Zaki Al-Afrani</p>

I am a software engineer. I love to compose my poetry with [golang](https://golang.org) and still in love with linux since 2006. As an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) person, I love watching people's act from distance. I am not good to explain a thing with words, but I will share a few things from my daily life.

This blog made by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and themed with [Kiko](http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko).
