Welcome to the holy month. When there is so many advantage we can get as human being who believed.

In this month, Allah s.w.t [command us](http://quran.com/2/183):

```
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ
```

We can pray and worship Allah s.w.t all the time easier because devils chained up. As Rasulullah s.a.w [said](http://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/86) :

```
إِذَا جَاءَ رَمَضَانُ فُتِّحَتْ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ وَغُلِّقَتْ أَبْوَابُ النَّارِ وَصُفِّدَتِ الشَّيَاطِينُ
```

But there is also a test. It will test my patient, cooking, worship, and absolutely *withstand to loneliness* skill. For me, being far from family in Ramadhan is the toughest one.

So, this is the first *non-tech* post in this blog and from now I will post anything what come to my mind to this blog. We'll see.
